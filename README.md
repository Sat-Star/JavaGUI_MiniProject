# JavaGUI_MiniProject
Student registration (Proctor Diary) using GUI and MySQL with  Java.

Please note that to run this project you'll need to create a MySQL database, I have used the name "JavaCrud" for database and "student" for the table in it. 
You can keep any other name but remember to change the code corresponding to that.
Also, I recommend running this in Eclipse, it doesn't work in VS Code for some reason.

You'll have to add the required .jar files to the project build path to successfully run the project.
The jar files are 'mysql-connector-j-8.0.32.jar' and 'rs2xml.jar' . You can download them from the internet.
Will update the readme upon gaining more knowledge.
